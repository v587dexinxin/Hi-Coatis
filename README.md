# Hi-Coatis
we developed Hi-Coatis (High-throughput Capture of Actively Transcribed Region-Interacting Sequences), a novel chromatin conformation capture technology that seamlessly integrates the detection of active transcription signals with three-dimensional chromatin interaction studies. Hi-Coatis operates without antibodies or probes, enabling low-input cells experiments with high resolution and robustness, capturing more than 93% of expressed genes and over 60,000 regulatory loci. 

This is the code used to make a pipeline for analysing Hi-Coatis data. In this work, all data generated in this study have been deposited to the Genome Sequence Archive in BGI Data Center (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gsa/) with the GSA accession number HRA009396. We use the human hg38 genome as reference, and we obtained the public Hi-C, Chip-seq, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq datasets of  K562 and HCT116 cell lines from ENDCODE database.
